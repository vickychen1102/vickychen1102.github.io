<p>This picture is generated by a AI painter,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and the website is&nbsp; &nbsp;dream.ai,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and I think the picture is very realistic and also it perfectly illustrated the action of a border collie.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I put those picture in photoshop, then I put them together.</p>
