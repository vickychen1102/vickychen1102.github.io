<p2>My biggest hobbie is debate. I have been debating for 1 year, I feel like I find myself when I am debating, I had met different topics which some I am interesting in and some I don't like, evertime I try my best to get a good score. I will keep debating to improve my skills.&nbsp;</p2>
<p>My favorite subject is that PE, I can get a chance to excersice in scholl, also it help me to improve teamwork.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
