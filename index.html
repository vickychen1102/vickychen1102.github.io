<h1>&nbsp;MY Introduction</h1>
<h2><strong>&nbsp;Hello World</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Hello, I am Vicky Chen, I am 13 years old, I have a pet dog called Alston, he is a boarder collie. I like to play with my pet dog in my spare time. I live with my mom and my dad, we usaully go to&nbsp; grandma and grandpa's house at weekends</p>
<p>My biggest hobbie is debate. I have been debating for 1 year, I feel like I find myself when I am debating, I had met different topics which some I am interesting in and some I don't like, evertime I try my best to get a good score. I will keep debating to improve my skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My favorite subject is that PE, I can get a chance to excersice in scholl, also it help me to improve teamwork.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
